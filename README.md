## Overview

ROS 1 (Robot Operating System) is a flexible, open-source framework that helps developers build, test, and control robots by connecting different software modules. This repository showcases ROS features using examples like TurtleBot navigation and Gazebo simulations. In this project, teams are assigned to design a custom arena and leverage the mapping and navigation capabilities of the AgileX LIMO robot, powered by ROS. The LIMO uses ROS features to detect and avoid obstacles while autonomously navigating through environments of varying complexity.
