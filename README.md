## Overview

ROS 1 (Robot Operating System) is a flexible, open-source framework that helps developers build, test, and control robots by connecting different software modules.

This repository showcases ROS features through practical applications like TurtleBot navigation and Gazebo simulations. In this project, teams were assigned to:

- Design a custom arena
- Utilize the mapping and navigation capabilities of the AgileX **LIMO robot**
- Implement real-time obstacle detection and autonomous navigation using ROS nodes

The result is a hands-on demonstration of ROS 1's powerful navigation stack in dynamically complex environments.

## Navigation

The LIMO robot performs SLAM and path planning to autonomously navigate through the arena. We utilized:

- `move_base`
- `gmapping`
- `amcl`

This is an example of the LIMO robot's waypoint coordinate:

## Arena Design & Creation

The arena was designed to simulate real-world scenarios, including narrow paths and obstacle-rich regions. Gazebo and RViz were used to test and visualize the robot's performance.
